Welcome to the Firebase Movie App! This project is one of the best projects I have made.This project is designed to provide users with a seamless experience in exploring and discovering information about movies. Leveraging Firebase for authentication and data storage, along with various technologies like React, REST API, Context API, and Tailwind CSS, this app offers an intuitive interface coupled with robust functionality.
